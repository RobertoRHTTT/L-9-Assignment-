                The days were ripe with a hunger of sweetness that could only be quenched 1 way.<br>
                The days knew very well that the time for hunting was now.<br>
                The time for searching and the time for taking.<br>
                Life has always been for the taking like ripe fruit to a yearn of the stomach.
